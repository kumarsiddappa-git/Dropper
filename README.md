Which sections of the PE we can put our code into


Today Lets try to understand different sections we can place the code or shellcode in the PE file.

PE has many sections , but we would be concentrating on 
1. .text
2. .data
3. .rsrc

To do that lets create a simple code which helps us to understand more , for this we need visual studio (or gcc compiler being installed and use it to compile and create an exe file to run) and x64dbg
https://x64dbg.com/ to download the x64dbg debugger and install is simple
